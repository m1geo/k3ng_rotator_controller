# K3NG Rotator Controller

This version of this software has been hacked about to use the openGLCD libraries to drive a graphics LCD. Currently, it font-maps a standard Hitachi LCD, but will support any openGLCD function. It just needs code to graw arrows, etc.

## Introduction

This is an Arduino-based rotator interface that interfaces a computer to a rotator or rotator controller, emulating the Yaesu GS-232A/B and Easycom protocols which are supported by a myriad of logging, contest, and control programs.  It can be easily interfaced with commercial rotator control units.  With the addition of a proper capacity power supply and several interface components such as relays, this unit could also serve as a total replacement for a rotator control unit or serve as the basis for a 100% homebrew rotation system.  Several azimuth and elevation position sensors including potentiometers, rotary encoders, and I2C devices are supported.  The code is very flexible, modular, and easy to read allowing intermediate and advanced experimenters and builders to customize it.

## Support and Feature Requests

Please consult [this page](https://blog.radioartisan.com/support-for-k3ng-projects/) for support information.  Feature requests and bugs are documented and tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller/issues).

Please note that I do this work in my spare time as I can and I am not a professional developer, however I play one on TV.  I do my best to answer support requests,  however I don’t like having to answer questions for items that are explained in the [documentation](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller/wiki).  I do maintain a list of [feature requests](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller/issues).  Development items are prioritized by me based on the level of difficulty and what I’m interested in.  I welcome code contributions, code testing, bug reports, and any help you can provide.  This can even be helping with [documentation](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller/wiki) or providing support to others on the [Radio Artisan discussion group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/radioartisan/info).
